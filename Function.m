    % function that you are creating 
    
    % In this case the script name is called "Function.m" therefore to
    % write a function;
    
    function Output = Function( Inputs )
        % Whatever operations you want to do then output it
        Output = Inputs * Conditions; % 
    end

%% Calling a function

    % Once you've successfully written a function you cannot just hit the
    % "run" button
    % You need to write the name of your function in the command window
    % In this case write down "Function(Inputs)"
