%% Thinking process
% Just implementing the rotation matrix as shown in the question

%% Solution 
function [R,b,c] = vectorRotate(a)
    %R = ...; Create rotation matrix that rotates by 45 degrees
    theta = 45;
    R = [cos(theta) -sin(theta);
         sin(theta)  cos(theta) ];
    %b = ...; rotate a by 45 degrees
    b = 
    %c = ...; rotate b by 45 degrees
end
